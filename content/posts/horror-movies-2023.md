Here's my list, seperated into three categories. The Best, Great, and Good because 1) every movie is a special baby and 2) if I didn't like it at all I wouldn't put it here. Also, horror movies is a loose category that encompasses generally spooky or macabre things even if the movie is not a SCARY movie.

## The Best

The Addiction (1995)
The Black Cat (1934) (_rewatch_)

## Great

The Autopsy of Jane Doe
The Fly (1958) (_rewatch_)
